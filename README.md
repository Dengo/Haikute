Haikute 
=======

"Haikute" is our attempt at a haiku generator that will incorporate various libraries from the Natural Language Toolkit in its functionality. 

Our immediate goals:

- Use NLTK to study the syllabic structures of haikus provided in Project Gutenberg (machine learning)
- Pull phonetic transcriptions and lexical entries from the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary 
- Create a basic syllabification algorithm for English
- Create a framework-less application to house the haiku generator 

Eventually, we also hope to enable "Haikute" to accept user input about a target individual, so that the forthcoming haiku will be tailored to flirt with that person. In other words, we hope to build a flirtatious haiku generator. When people think of our generator, they will exclaim, "Haikute! That little flirt!"
